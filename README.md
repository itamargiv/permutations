# Permutations

This library allows for an easy way to quickly create permutations of various 
data structures. It is heavily based on the permutations function as written for 
Haskell in the [Data.List module](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/src/Data.OldList.html#permutations).
